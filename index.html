            Hey there, welcome to my portfolio. I'm Skylar, and I am a trans woman out of the USA with a fixation on almost anything tech. 
			Throughout my years, I've found myself working with several coding languages such as <strong>C#</strong>, 
																								 <strong>Arduino C (simplified mix of C and C++)</strong>, 
																								 <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, 
																								 and a touch of <strong>Javascript</strong>.
		    <br>
		    <br>
			I started my career somewhere in 2019, after seeing BONEWORKS for the first time. Since then, I've been fascinated by VR and what exactly it can do for people.
			I've had very few chances to actually <em>release</em> a game, so most of what you'll find here are the many tech demos I've thrown together to learn and experiment over the years.
			<br>
			<br>
			As a fun sidenote, any and all media seen here is hosted from my homelab server running Windows 10 and Copyparty fit with a Nexsan JBOD :3

                    <p>Scamper was the first released game that I got the chance to work on. 
					I helped in writing the original multiplayer update, as well as assist in re-writing the game from scratch for update v20 onward. 
					I still work on this to this day! :D

					Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to show much BTS on this project, so it just links to the steam page.</p>

                    <h3>Portable Physics Player</h3>
                    <p>A proposed, as the name suggests, Portable Physics Player that I could use across my future projects. It was using a "Floaty Rig" as its base and, all aroud, was pretty neat. Never quite got finshed, and I ended up gutting it for parts at some point, leaving it unusable. I plan to revisit this someday.</p>

                    <p>An SCP Shooter game that aimed to focus on and highlight the horrors that come with being an MTF agent. It was here that I first prototyped what I dub "Physics Based Networking" with advice from DrewMileham.</p>

                    <p>My first ever game project. It's original scope was to be a 4 player co-op survival game a-la "The Long Dark", but due to my inexperience, it obviously never took off the ground. I've yet to give up on the dream though. One day!</p>
